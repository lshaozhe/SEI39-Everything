# How to Successfully Learn in This Bootcamp

## Learning Objectives

- General advice and how to prepare yourself emotionally
- Some qualities of the most successful students
- Classroom culture
- Overview of "grit"
- Overview of common student concerns

---

## Emotional Framing

- Things will not go as you plan

![plan vs reality](https://i.imgur.com/GVPjMB1.png)

- Deal with chaos in your head. Being confused/lost is **NORMAL**. No one pays you because you know all the answers. The job is about jumping into confusion and being able to find a solution.  Make a friend with discomfort

- The maximum point of learning is right at the edge of learning and panic.

- This experience is a rollercoaster.

## Successful students

- The most successful students find programming fascinating. They don't think
of it as an obligation or chore.

- The most successful students go above and beyond what we teach. If there is
something they feel they should know, they will go and learn it. If there is a
problem for which they think they need more information to solve, they go and find that information.

- The most successful students don't wait for instructors to hand them the answer.

- Successful students quickly see that programming is not about learning a recipe,
it's about developing a mindset to solve unforeseen problems.

- Hard Work: the equivalent of two :two: full-time jobs (`~80` hrs per week).

- Be open and ready to receive constructive criticism

## Classroom Culture

- Open safe environment
- Take ownership of your experience
- Check your ego at the door
- Empathy
- Be courteous calm and patient with others.  Don't let the stress get to you!
- Don't compare yourself to others, compare yourself to who you were yesterday

### Mentorship / Collaborative Culture in the Classroom

- Take care of each other
- Benchmarking: some are good at one thing, others at another. Leverage each other's strengths.
- Teaching is the best way of truly solidifying your understanding of a concept.
- Your classmates will be the best foundation for establishing a professional network in tech!

## Grit

- Jill's example is being used only because of the great photo. Her story is **not** unique.
- This is like three months of "cramming for finals"

## Common Student Concerns

- I'm making a lot of mistakes
  - mistakes are a part of life as a developer

- I don't feel comfortable with the material
  - you probably will never feel the material is easy, but you should be able to do the work
  - by the end of each unit project, you should feel mostly comfortable with the material

- I feel good during class, but it's difficult to innovate on my own
  - There are three :three: stages to learning something:
    - Imitation (follow along)
    - Assimilation (repetitive simple tasks: homework and labs)
    - Innovation (build something new on your own - project time)

- Everyone at work will realize I know nothing
  - this is called the imposter syndrome, and it's very common
  - nobody knows everything, it's about how well you learn

- I don't "do" :heavy_division_sign: math
  - that's why we have the computer do it for us!
  - programming is more about thinking logically than doing equations

- What's the best practice? What's the one :one: "correct" answer?
  - Best practices change constantly and from company to company
  - If you think properly, you'll probably naturally arrive at a best practice
  - All that matters is "Does it work?"
    - A company that hires someone with `3` months of experience doesn't really care about code quality
    - Use your time to learn new technology or strengthen your problem solving

- I don't have a perfect understanding of everything
  - Class is set up to accommodate students of all abilities
    - We create lecture notes, homework, and projects so that advanced students can have something to work on
  - We make sure you understand at least the most important concepts
  - Only the people who write the specifications for the language understand everything about the language

- I want an amazing portfolio and to complete all my labs/assignments
  - all projects will be prototype quality - they are the start of a great idea, they won't be fully featured: most apps/websites take a team and at least `6` months to launch
    - You will only get a few days to work on a project
    - You are learning how to build things, it takes time
    - You're working on your projects on your own and not on a team

- Remember these things and don't be too hard on yourself
  - what matters is the ability to think and that you are learning
  - don't worry about completing every lab/homework
    - this is an adult learning environment thus we have a broad range of skill levels entering the course. We strive to have material for everyone to get the most out of this class.
    - Naturally, students who have already been coding for a while will get through more labs/hw. If you are newer to coding, many times you won't get to the bonus activities and that's ok.
    - You'll get feedback on your hw - if you are struggling, we'll coach you to help you get the most out of the material and this course

- You are trying to make a career `180` in just `12` working weeks. This is a massive undertaking in a very short amount of time.
  - We expect you to work hard, but never to the point where you are sacrificing taking care of yourself
    - completing and sleeping for `2` hours is worse than sleeping and not completing
    - if you come into a new day tired and sleep deprived you won't be able to grasp the concepts as well
    - we have a lot of repetition and reviews built in to our curriculum, a lot of learning comes from practicing and repeating.
    - It's ok if you don't get something right away, or on the first day or week. A lot of concepts come together by the end of the unit.

### Notes

- Lessons will start slow and speed up (if possible)
- This course is not to teach you the ins and outs of programming languages
- Ask questions during the lessons and labs, other words interrupt me if you need to clarify.
