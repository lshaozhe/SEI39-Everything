## Overview

Let's start out with something fun - **a game!**

Everyone will get a chance to **be creative**, and work through some really **tough programming challenges** -- since you've already gotten your feet wet with Tic Tac Toe, it's up to you to come up with a fun and interesting game to build.

**You will be working individually for this project**, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got!

We will approve your project before you begin. Please share with us the following **Tuesday, 6th Sep 2022**.
- Project concept, game play ideas, designs (sketches/screenshots/wireframes if necessary)
- Your MVP (see below for definition of MVP)
- Other features you plan to implement

### Technical Requirements

Your app needs to:
* **Display a game in the browser**
* be interactive
* **Include separate HTML / CSS / JavaScript files**
* Use **Javascript** for **DOM manipulation** that is triggered by a **browser event**

### Schedule and Deliverables

#### Project Schedule
- Soft Launch
    - There will be a soft launch of your project with the instructional team on Tuesday **13 Sep 2022**.
    - The soft launch is for you to share the MVP (or current state of the project) and the remaining todos/plans for your project.
    - Be sure to work on a separate branch or take note of your working commit so you can refer back to it during the soft launch.
- Project Presentation
    - The project presentation to the class will be on Friday, **16 Sep 2022**. 
    - Presentation flow 
        - **Showcase** your game (show not tell) ~5mins
        - Suggested flow:
            - Overall game flow
            - Most challenging part of the project
            - Further work and next steps
        - Q&A ~5mins this will the opportunity for the class (or instructional team) to ask you more about the technical/design aspects of your game. 

#### Final Deliverables to be submitted before (17 Sep 2022 5pm)
* A **non-broken game, built by you**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working game** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted game, and frequent commits dating back to the very beginning of the project
* **A ``readme.md`` file** with explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.


## Work Strategies

### Motivations

Almost *any* game will satisfy the basic technical requirements of the project.

One choice you must make in choosing *which* game to make is your goal and motivation for choosing that game, and if you can accomplish that goal within the given time.

Some possible reasons for choosing a given game:

- this game will help me understand CSS better
- this game will be an important part of my portfolio
- this game will help me understand setInterval
- this game will help me review and shore up my javascript basics

### Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Break the project down into different components** (data, presentation, views, style, DOM manipulation) and brainstorm each component individually. Use whiteboards!
* **Use your Development Tools** (console.log, inspector, alert statements, etc) to debug and solve problems
* Work through the lessons in class & ask questions when you need to! Think about adding relevant code to your game each night, instead of, you know... _procrastinating_.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don't be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Consult documentation resources** (MDN, jQuery, etc.) at home to better understand what you'll be getting into.
* **Don't be afraid to write code that you know you will have to remove later.** Create temporary elements (buttons, links, etc) that trigger events if real data is not available. For example, if you're trying to figure out how to change some text when the game is over but you haven't solved the win/lose game logic, you can create a button to simulate that until then.
* **Use pseudo code** write out notes to yourself about what needs to happen next in your program
* **Write comments** comments are notes to yourself about what your code does. this will help you if you forget later (remember that explaining your code is a requirement of the project)
* **Document your functions** use the exercise of defining your function data as an opprtunity to think about what your program needs to do

### Program Structure

Remember that your program should break down into several distinct parts:

- **take user input** Process that input as needed `parseInt`, change a click action into a `true` value, increment a counter
- **process that new data** Run a loop, function or conditional given that the user has done something / the data in your program has changed
- **show something to the user** Manipulate the DOM to display a new state or content to the user. \

### Understand your MVP

What is the minimum functionality your game needs to be playable? (The minimum funnctionality for tic tac toe is that the game "player" changes from X to O)

Clearly define **exactly** what that functionality is that you want to have before you begin coding.

Keep in mind your structure and variables for future expansion, but **never** write any code that doesn't have to do with your current goal. 

Don't worry about throwing away some code in the next version, after you get the MVP done.

After defining your MVP, your code should still break down into many sub-tasks. These also need to be clearly defined.


### Agile Workflow
* small problems make large problems easier to solve.

## Potential Project Ideas

You may be tempted to do a more visually-related dynamic game, (pacman, pong) but within the curriculum of SEI, *a game that is turned based is more relevant to the idea of a web application.*

That isn't to say that a turn based game is simple or easy to create or code. For example, if the play of the game is easy to implement, you can simply implement a computer player in the game.

Here are some examples of turn based games with simple game mechanics: [http://www.thegamesjournal.com/articles/GameSystems4.shtml](http://www.thegamesjournal.com/articles/GameSystems4.shtml)


##### Blackjack
Make a one player game where people down on their luck can lose all their money by guessing which card the computer will deal next!

Other card games: [https://bargames101.com/two-player-card-games](https://bargames101.com/two-player-card-games)

##### Hangman
Guess a word one at a time until you run out of guesses or you guess the word.

##### Nim
Take a number of coins from one of a number of stacks. The last player to take a coin wins. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nim)

## Feedback + Evaluation
The project is meant to demonstrate that everyone is minimally capable of __applying__ the things we saw during class.

Given __Bloom's Taxonomy__ students should be able to apply their knowledge of HTML, CSS and javascript. Students must remember enough of the concepts to to understand how to apply their knowledge / build this project.

Students are expected to be able to answer simple questions about their code, such as *"what does this line of code do?"*, *"why did you decide to put this line here?"* and *"if I changed this value from 0 to 1 what would happen?"*

Students are not expected to know from memory the answers to these questions, but they should be able to work through their own code to come up with the answer, unprompted.

Students can copy as much code as they want, provided that they can explain their **reasoning** for copying, and explain **what the code does**, line by line.

### Post Mortem
After the project we will ask you to reflect on what went well and what can be improved upon. This self-reflection will be an important part of improving your work moving forward.
