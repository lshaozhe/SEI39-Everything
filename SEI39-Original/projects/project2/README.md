# Project #2: React Application

## Overview:

Your will be creating a front end application using React.

This is exciting! It's a lot, but we have faith in you! You've learned the necessary tools over the past few weeks to be able build what you need, and you get to decide what you do with it. And you get to be creative in choosing what sort of application you want to build!

You will be working individually for this project, and you'll be designing the app yourself, but we'll be guiding you along the process and helping as you go. Show us what you've got! We hope you'll exercise creativity on this project, sketch some wireframes before you start, and write user stories to define what your users will want to do with the app. Make sure you have time to run these ideas by your instructors to get their feedback before you dive too deep into code! 

Remember to keep things small and focus on mastering the fundamentals – scope creep/feature creep is the biggest pitfall for any project!

## Technical Requirements

- **Build a web application using create-react-app**.  Must be your own work.
- **Use React framework** to build your application with *at least* 
  - 3 components
  - 4 props
  - 1 lifting state
  - 2 states
  - 2 setState
  - 2 routes
- **Use 3rd party API and/or Firestore**
  - Calling an API and displaying the data for the user. You may use any API of your choosing or [Find an available API here](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis)
  - You may also opt to use Firebase/Firestore if you need to store data.
- **Craft a `README.md` file that explains your app** to the world. [README Template](https://github.com/SEI2-jeddah/README-Template/blob/master/README.md)
- **Create wireframes** for your app and include it in your repo/readme.

## Project Schedule
- Project Proposal: **29 Sep 2022**
- Check In: **4 Oct 2022**
- Project Presentation:  **7 Oct 2022**
- Deliverables are due by **8 Oct 2022, 5:00pm**


## Deliverables
- Update your daily progress 
- Link to github repo
- Link to working app (optional)
- `ReadMe.md` file that explains your app to the world.

## Project Presentation

2 minute demo of your application
  - Show us the functionality!

10 minute presentation (suggested flow)
  - What is the application about?
  - What are the user stories for your application?
  - What API did you choose to use?
  - Walk through a piece of code
  - What was the most difficult part of the project?
  - What was your favourite part of your project?
  - What would you like to add next?
  
  
### Stretch Goals

>DO NOT attempt stretch goals until all MVP requirements have been met!

- Use more than 1 API
- Use a React component library like [Ant Design](https://ant.design/docs/react/introduce) or [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/)
- Add User Sign Up, Sign In, and Sign Out with [Firebase and React Authentication (tutorial)](https://medium.com/firebase-developers/how-to-setup-firebase-authentication-with-react-in-5-minutes-maybe-10-bb8bb53e8834), alternative tutorial [here](https://css-tricks.com/firebase-react-part-2-user-authentication/) (can be very challenging)

## Suggested Ways to Get Started
- Think of a problem in your daily life that could be potentially be solved with technology or an app. Distill the problem down to the simplest case and design an React MVP that can solve a simple version of it.
- **Begin with the end in mind.** Know where you want to go by planning with wireframes & user stories, so you don't waste time building things you don't need
- **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code to solve short term problems**
- **Read the docs for whatever technologies you use.** Most of the time, there is a tutorial that you can follow, but not always, and learning to read documentation is crucial to your success as a developer
- **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
- **User stories define what a specific type of user wants to accomplish with your application.** It's tempting to just make them to-do lists for what needs to get done, but if you keep them small & focused on what a user cares about from their perspective, it'll help you know what to build
- **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.
