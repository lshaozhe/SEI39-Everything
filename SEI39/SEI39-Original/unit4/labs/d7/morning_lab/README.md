For today's morning lab, you'll be getting practice with the SQL commands you just learned. 

_NOTE!_ To create a new postgres database without connecting to psql, in terminal bash just run `createdb [databasename]` where [databasename] is whatever you want to name your new database.

### Activity

1. Start by working in the `computers.sql` file and follow the directions outlined there
1. Move onto the `televisions.sql` file and follow the directions outlined there

##### :red_circle: How to run .sql files in terminal: 

  - To run the .sql files, use the command: `psql -f sql_file_name.sql database_name` 
      - For example: `psql -f computers.sql sql_lab` 

### Hungry for More?

If you finish both files, try out the [realty lab](../realty)! ohh no more realty.. oops 404. @bryan
