# Create a variable called title_or_ratings, set to 1.
# You should be able to change this between 1, 2, and 3 to change what your program prints.

# Create a variable `movie_title` and set it to "Back to the Future".
movie_title = "Back to the Future"

# Create a variable `movie rating` to hold the rating and set it to `8`.
movie_rating = 8

# Create a function, print_movie_title, that prints the movie title.

# Create a function, print_movie_rating, that prints the movie rating.
  
# Create a function, print_single_movie_rating, that prints the string you had in lab 1.

# Create a function, print_all_ratings, that takes one argument movie_list.
# This prints "The movie <movie> has a great rating!"

# Create one main function which will call everything else - subsituting function calls for the print statements.

# Inside the main function, create a default_movie_list with "Back to the Future", "Blade", and "Spirited Away"
    
# Inside the main function, call the print_all_ratings function and pass it the default_movie_list as a parameter
  
# Inside the main function, put your print statement from the previous lab but subsitute function calls.

# If title_or_ratings is 1, call print_movie_title
# If title_or_ratings is 2, call print_movie_rating().
# If title_or_ratings is 3, call print_single_movie_rating()

# Start with this prompt for your `main` function
# It tells Python to go directly to the main function and run that
