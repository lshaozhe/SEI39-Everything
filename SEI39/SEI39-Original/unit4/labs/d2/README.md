<h1>Unit 1 Lab: Variables</h1>

## Overview
This lesson consists of a hands-on lab during which you will independently create a working Python program. 

## Learning Objectives
In this lesson, you will:
- Apply what you've learned in Day 1 to create a working Python program.

## You Do: Unit 1 Lab — Variables

A "You Do" is an exercise for you to try on your own!  

In today’s lab, you will:

- Create the bones of a movie-rating app that we’ll be adding on to at the end of each unit.

- Print complex variables.

Open the file [Unit Lab 1 Directions](unit_lab_1_directions.md) to see the lab and its instructions. Follow the instructions there.

Try your best! Raise your hand if you really need help.


25 MINUTES


- Throughout the course, there is a lab at the end of each unit. Each lab builds upon the last.

- At the end Unit 5's lab, you'll have an app that asks the user to enter a movie title. Your app will then search for that movie on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/" target="\_blank">Rotten Tomatoes</a> and print the search results and the Rotten Tomatoes rating.

- For example, if a user searches in your app for "Blade," your app can get a list of results: "Blade," "Blade II," "Blade Runner," "Blade Runner 2049," and "Blade of the Immortal (Mugen no jûnin)." Your app can also tell the user that *Blade* has a 54% rating on Rotten Tomatoes.

- It's going to be awesome!

- Right now, let's set up some variables and print out their values.

## Debrief: Day 1 Lab — Variables

How did it go?

Let's go over it.

Make sure your code works — the Day 2 lab builds off this one!
---

## Day 1 Wrap-Up

What'd we do?

- Explored the concept of variables and differentiated between variable types.
- Created and reassigned numerical variables using common naming guidelines and numerical operators.
- Reassigned variables using variables and shorthand assignment operators.
- Created string variables, concatenate strings, and print complex structures.

Questions?

5 MINUTES

- Wow, we've covered a lot, and we're just getting started! Let's take a minute to review what we've learned so far.
- I'm going to read through the learning objectives for Unit 1. As I do so, I want you to tell me how confident you feel that you've mastered each one on a scale of 0 to 5. Hold up your fist to indicate 0: You don't feel confident at all that you mastered this objective. Hold up all five fingers to indicate 5: You feel super confident. You're an expert!
