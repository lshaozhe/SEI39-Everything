## Blueprints

All cars have things that make them a `Car`. Although the details might be different, every type of car has the same basics — it's off the same blueprint, with the same properties and actions.

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ga-instruction/assets/programming-fundamentals/class-objects-car.png)

- Property: A shape (could be hatchback or sedan).
- Property: A color (could be red, black, blue, or silver).
- Property: Seats (could be between 2 and 5).
- Action: Can drive.
- Action: Can park.

- When we make a car, we can vary the values of these properties. Some cars have economy engines, some have performance engines.
Some have four doors, others have two. However, they are all types of `Car`s.

- Take particular note of the small "c" versus the big "C"!
- Can you think of other commonalities of cars — get them thinking about an archetypal car.

---

## Introduction: Objects and Classes

These properties and behaviors can be thought of as variables and functions.

`Car` blueprint:

- Properties (variables): `shape`, `color`, `seats`
- Actions (functions): `drive()` and `park()`

An actual car might have:

```python
# **Properties - Variables**:
- shape = "hatchback"
- color = "red", "black", "blue", or "silver"
- seats = 2

# **Actions - Functions:**
- drive()
- park()
- reverse()
```

**Discussion:** What might a blueprint for a chair look like?

**Talking Points:**

- Every day, we interact with objects like chairs, beverages, cars, other people, etc. These objects have properties that define them and behaviors we can execute to interact with them.

---

## Discussion: Python Classes

In Python, the concept of blueprints and objects is common. A **class** is the blueprint for an **object**. Everything you declare in Python is an object, and it has a class.

Consider the `List` class — every list you make has the same basic concept.

Variables:

- Elements: What's in the list! E.g., `my_list = [element1, element2, element3]`.

Functions that all lists have:

- `my_list.pop()`, `my_list.append()`, `my.list.insert(index)`

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ga-instruction/assets/programming-fundamentals/pythonlistclass.png)

What behaviors and properties do you think are in the `Dictionary` class? The `Set` class?

**Talking Points:**

- Similarly, you will hear people say that "everything is an object" in Python. Python is an object-oriented programming language.
- What this means is that nearly every variable you declare actually has a set of properties and functions that it can use — it is an object.
- Every string, number, list, dictionary, etc. has a set of behaviors and properties that are "baked in" because they are instances of a class.
- Every list you declare has properties (the values in it) and behaviors — functions like `append()` and `pop()`.
- In Python, there is a built-in `List` class, which has the ability to hold values, and built-in list functions like `append()` and `pop()`. When you declare a list in Python, you're making your own list object that's a variation of the `List` class.

---

## Discussion: A `Dog` Class

We can make a class for anything! Let's create a `Dog` class.

The objects might be `greyhound`, `goldenRetriever`, `corgi`, etc.

Think about the `Dog` blueprint. What variables might our class have? What functions?

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ga-instruction/assets/programming-fundamentals/class-dog-blueprint.png)

**Pro tip:** When functions are in a class, they are called "methods." They're the same thing!

**Pro tip:** While objects are named in snake_case, classes are conventionally named in TitleCase.

---

## We Do: Defining Classes

Follow along! Let's create a new file, `Dog.py`.

Class definitions are similar to function definitions, but instead of `def`, we use `class`.

Let's declare a class for `Dog`:

```python
class Dog():
 # We'll define the class here.
 # Our dog will have two variables: name and age.
```

![](https://s3.amazonaws.com/ga-instruction/assets/programming-fundamentals/class-dog-name-age.png)

**Pro tip:** Files are usually named for their class, so the `Dog` class is in `Dog.py`.

**Talking Points:**

- It's very common in programming to make our own classes to organize data in the ways we want. Python gives us, for example, a string and an integer.
- What if we want to store a bunch of data where each item contains a string **and** an integer **and** a function that prints them out nicely?
- We can make a class for that, and then each object we make from that class will have that all baked in.

---

## We Do: The `__init__` Method

What first? Every class starts with an `__init__` method. It's:

- Where we define the class' variables.
- Short for "initialize."
  - "Every time you make an object from this class, do what's in here."

Let's add this:

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name="", age=0):
        # Note the optional parameters and defaults.
        self.name = name  # All dogs have a name.
        self.age = age  # All dogs have an age.
```

*Note: `self` means "each individual object made from this class." Not every "dog" has the same name!*

- `Self` is tough! It will make more sense after you start creating objects. Don't spend more than a few minutes on it — go back to it when comparing instance versus class variables.
- Call out the default values, or optional parameters, as we very recently learned them.
- Method means function!

- When we make an object, we'll first set its variables.
- The first argument passed to the `__init__` function, `self`, is required when defining methods for classes. The `self` argument is a reference to a future instantiation of the class. In other words, `self` refers to each individual dog.
- This lets each object made from a class keep references to its own data and function members. Not every "dog" has the same attributes, so we want individual cars to maintain their own attributes.
- Python allows us to provide default values for parameters in any function we provide. Here, if no `name` or `age` values are provided when a `Dog` is initialized, they will default. To create default values, we assign values to the parameter `capacity` *inside* the parentheses. You've seen this!

---

## We Do: Adding a `bark_hello()` Method

All dogs have the behavior `bark`, so let's add that. This is a regular function (method), just inside the class!

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name="", age=0):
        # Note the defaults.

        self.name = name  # All dogs have a name.
        self.age = age  # All dogs have an age.

    # All dogs have a bark function.
    def bark_hello(self):
        print("Woof! I am called", self.name, "; I am", self.age, "human-years old.")
```

We're done defining the class!

- Note that it takes `self`! This will be tough to remember. Point out that it matches how the variable was declared.

---

## Aside: Instantiating Objects From Classes

Now we have a `Dog` template!

Each `dog` object we make from this template:

- Has a name.
- Has an age.
- Can bark.

- Take special note of the lowercase "d!"

---

## We Do: How Do We Make a `Dog` Object?

We call our class name like we call a function — passing in arguments, which go to the `init`.

Add this under your class (non-indented!):

```python
# Declare the objects.
gracie = Dog("Gracie", 8)
spitz = Dog("Spitz", 5)
buck = Dog("Buck", 3)

# Test them out!
gracie.bark_hello()
print("This dog's name is", gracie.name)
print("This dog's age is", gracie.age)
spitz.bark_hello()
buck.bark_hello()
```

Try it! Run `Dog.py` like a normal Python file: `python Dog.py`.

- Map out that these variables go to `__init__` to get created. All arguments go to `__init__`!
- You have a working class! Go back through the whole code and make sure you understand.

**Talking Points:**

- This will create a new object according to our `Dog` class specification.
- Python runs our `__init__` method to initialize the object.
- Here, we are telling our `__init__` method to set the name of this `dog` to `'Gracie'` and set her age to `8` years old.
- Even though `self` is listed as a parameter for the `bark_hello()` function, we don't pass it into the function. It happens automatically.

---

## We Do: Adding Print

`__init__` is just a method. It creates variables, but we can also add a `print` statement! This will run when we create the object.

```python
class Dog:
    def __init__(self, name="", age=0):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        print(name, "created.")  # Run when init is finished.

    def bark_hello(self):
        print("Woof! I am called", self.name, "; I am", self.age, "human-years old.")


fox = Dog("Fox")  #  Note that "Fox created." prints — and we're using the default age.
fox.bark_hello()
```

Try it!

- Run this a few times to show the default variables. Take out the default for name to observe that variables don't need a default value.

**Talking Points:**

- Reminder: "Method" is a function in a class.
- Note that `print` statements can be anywhere — it's not a variable! `__init__` is a method.
- The `__init__` method will execute once and only once when you create a new object from a class. Note that the `print` statement never happens again.

---

## Quick Review: Classes

A class is a blueprint for an object. Some classes are built into Python, like `List`. We can always make a `list` object.

We can make a class for anything!

```python
# Created like a function; TitleCase
class Dog:

    # __init__: A method (function) that happens just once, when the object is created.
    def __init__(self, name="", age=0):  # What's passed in to the class is used here.
        # Set variables for each.
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        print(name, "created.")  # This will run when the __init__ method is called.

    # Classes can have as many methods (functions) as you'd like.
    def bark_hello(self):
        print("Woof! I am called", self.name, "; I am", self.age, "human-years old.")


fox = Dog("Fox")  # Creating the object calls __init__. Objects are snake_case.
print("This dog's name is", fox.name)  # The object now has those variables!
fox.bark_hello()  # The object now has those methods and variables!
```

**Teaching Tips:**

- Add your own reasons for why classes are useful.
- Do a quick check for understanding.
- Run down the comments in the code like they're bullet points!

## Discussion: What About Tea?

Let's make a `TeaCup` class.

- What variables would a cup of tea have?
- What methods?

- Discuss suggestions for properties for a `Tea` class.
- The exercise has `capacity`, `amount`, `fill`, `empty`, and `drink`.

---

## A Potential `TeaCup` Class

We could say:

Variables:

- A total `capacity`.
- A current `amount`.

Methods:

- `fill()` our cup.
- `empty()` our cup.
- `drink()` some tea from our cup.

- Given a well-defined cup of tea, we can use the class definition to create **instances** of the class.
- Each **instance** of the `TeaCup` class can have a different `capacity` and keep track of different `amounts`.
- Although different, properties are affected by actions like `fill()`, `empty()`, and `drink()` similarly.

---

## Example: A `TeaCup` Class

Here's what a `TeaCup` class definition might look like in Python:

```python
class TeaCup:
    def __init__(self, capacity):
        # Python executes when a new cup of tea is created.
        self.capacity = capacity  # Total ounces the cup holds.
        self.amount = 0  # Current ounces in the cup. All cups start empty!

    def fill(self):
        self.amount = self.capacity

    def empty(self):
        self.amount = 0

    def drink(self, amount_drank):
        self.amount -= amount_drank
        # If it's empty, it stays empty!
        if self.amount == 0:
            self.amount = 0


steves_cup = TeaCup(12)  # Maybe a fancy tea latte.
yis_cup = TeaCup(16)  # It's a rough morning!
brandis_cup = TeaCup(2)  # Just a quick sip.
```

- This class doesn't take in `amount`! It's set as a variable, but not passed in. Can you explain this?
- Note that the object declarations have to go below the class. Show the error that occurs if you try calling `steves_cup` first.
- Call each function — `fill()`, `drink()` with a different number for each, and printing the amount left with `cup.amount`.

---

## Quick Knowledge Check

```python
class TeaCup():
  def __init__(self, capacity = 8):
    self.capacity = capacity
    self.amount = 0
```

When will the capacity be `8`?

- Answer: When no capacity is passed in when it's declared.

---

## Variables for All Class Objects

Next up: new types of class variables!

Let's revisit our `Dog` class:

```python
class Dog():
  def __init__(self, name="", age=0):
      self.name = name
      self.age = age
      print(name, "created.")

  def bark_hello(self):
      print("Woof! I am called", self.name, "; I am", self.age, "human-years old")
```

What if there are variables that we want across all dogs?

For example, can we count how many `dog` objects we make and track it in the class?

- Our `Dog` class had variables attached to `self` that exist independently for each object that's created.
  - Each object instance has its own copies of these variables, and they can vary across objects.
- We can attach variables to the class itself so that there's one single thing that exists for an entire class.

---

## I Do: Class vs. Instance Members

We already have **instance variables**, which are specific to each `dog` object (each has its own name!).

A **class variable** is specific to the class, regardless of the object. It's created **above** `__init__`.

```python
class Dog():
  ### Here, we define class variables. ###
  # These are the same for ALL dogs.
  total_dogs = 0

  def __init__(self, name="", age=0):

    ### These are instance variables. ###
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
    print(name, "created.")

  def bark_hello(self):
    print("Woof! I am called", self.name, "; I am", self.age, "human-years old")
    print("There are", Dog.total_dogs, "dogs in this room!") # There's no "self" — we call the Dog class name!

molly = Dog("Molly", 8)
molly.bark_hello()

sheera = Dog("Sheera", 5)
sheera.bark_hello()
```

**Talking Points:**

- Our `Dog` class had variables attached to `self` that exist independently for each object that's created.
  - These are called **instance variables**.
  - Each object instance has its own copies of these variables, and they can vary across objects.
- We can attach variables to the class itself so that there's one single thing that exists for an entire class.
  - These are called **class variables**.

---

## I Do: Tallying Dogs

We can increment the `class` variable any time.

```python
class Dog():
  total_dogs = 0
  def __init__(self, name="", age=0):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age
    Dog.total_dogs += 1 #  We can increment this here!
    print(name, "created:")

  def bark_hello(self):
    print("Woof! I am called", self.name, "; I am", self.age, "human-years old.")
    print("There are", Dog.total_dogs, "dogs in this room!")

molly = Dog("Molly", 8)
molly.bark_hello()

sheera = Dog("Sheera", 5)
sheera.bark_hello()
```

**Talking Points:**

- We can keep a tally of how many `dog`s we have running around in our app.
- We could put a copy of the tally in each `dog` object, but that's not efficient, as we would be duplicating a value in memory multiple times, and we would have to update the value in every `dog` object in order to keep it accurate.
- It's much better if we can store it in the class. That way, each `dog` object can access it, but we only need to store it and set it in one place.
- Finally, we create a new `dog`. The `__init__` method increments the `total_dogs` counter, which is stored in the `Dog` class itself. We can access the value stored in `Dog.total_dogs` inside our script, and each `dog` object can access it from their own functions.

---

## Partner Exercise: Create a Music Genre Class

Pair up! Create a new file, `Band.py`.

- Define a class, `Band`, with these instance variables: `"genre"`, `"band_name"`, and `"albums_released"` (defaulting to `0`).
- Give `Band` a method called `print_stats()`, which prints a string like `"The rock band Queen has 15 albums."`
- Create a class variable, `number_of_bands`, that tracks the number of bands created.

Test your code with calls like:

```python
my_band = Band("Queen", 15, "rock")
```

**Bonus:** If the genre provided isn't `"pop"`, `"classical"`, or `"rock"`, print out `"This isn't a genre I know."`

5-10 MINUTES

**Talking Points:**

- Imagine that you are working with music data of all different types of genres and want to ultimately define three different classes of music (pop, classical, and rock).
- Things to think about:
  - Starting values for variables should be set in the `__init__` method.
  - Class variables are declared inside the class but outside any methods.
  - Instance variables are declared inside the `__init__` method.
  - Does your `__init__` method need to accept any parameters?

---

## Partner Exercise: Create a `BankAccount` Class

Switch drivers! Create a new class (and file), `Bank.py`.

Bank accounts should:

- Be created with the `accountType` property (either `"savings"` or `"checking"`).
- Keep track of its current `balance`, which always starts at `0`.
- Have access to `deposit()` and `withdraw()` methods, which take in an integer and update `balance` accordingly.
- Have a class-level variable tracking the total amount of money in all accounts, adding or subtracting whenever `balance` changes.

**Bonus:** Start each account with an additional `overdraftFees` property that begins at `0`. If a call to `withdraw()` ends with the `balance` below `0`, then `overdraftFees` should be incremented by `20`.

10 MINUTES

**Talking Points:**

- (The same as above.)
- Things to think about:
  - Starting values for variables should be set in the `__init__` method.
  - Class variables are declared inside the class but outside any methods.
  - Instance variables are declared inside the `__init__` method.
  - Does your `__init__` method need to accept any parameters?

## Knowledge Check: Select the Best Answer

Consider the following class definition for `Cat()`:

```python
class Cat(Animal):
 def __init__(self, name='Lucky'):
  self.name = name
  self.fur = short
```

How would you instantiate a `Cat` object with the `name` attribute `'Furball'`?

1. `mycat = Cat(name='Furball')`
2. `furball = Cat()`
3. `mycat = Cat(self, name='Furball')`
4. `mycat = Cat.init(name='Furball')`

> **Answer:**

1. The `__init__` function is automatically called when creating an object with the `Cat(name='Furball')` syntax.

---

## Knowledge Check: Select All That Apply

Which of the following statements are true about the ```self``` argument in class definitions?

- The user does not need to supply `self` when using instance methods.
- The `self` argument is a reference to the instance object.
- Any variable assigned with `self` (e.g., `self.var`) will be shared across instances of the class.
- With an instance object, `obj`, entering `obj.self.var` will provide the value for `var` for that instance.

> **Answers:**

1. The user does not need to supply `self` when using instance methods.
2. The `self` argument is a reference to the instance object.

Correct response explanation:

- `self` is automatically passed into an instance method when you call it. `self` refers to the instance and NOT the class. `self.var` will not be shared between instances. Instances have no explicit `self` attribute.

---

## Knowledge Check: Select the Best Answer II

Consider the following code:

```python
class Shape(object):
    possible = ["triangle", "square", "circle", "pentagon", "polygon", "rectangle"]

    def __init__(self, label="triangle"):
        self.label = label

    def is_possible(self):
        if self.label in self.possible:
            print("This is possible")
        else:
            print("This is impossible")


square = Shape(label="square")
wormhole = Shape(label="wormhole")
square.possible.append("wormhole")
```

If you were to enter `wormhole.is_possible()`, would the outcome be `"This is possible"` or `"This is impossible"`?

> **Answer:**
`This is possible`

Correct answer explanation:

- The possible list is defined at the class level as opposed to as an instance variable. When we append the string `'wormhole'` to the possible list of the `square` object, this list is shared with the wormhole instance. Therefore the output will be `This is possible`.

---

## Summary: Discussion

Let's chat! Can anyone explain:

- What a class is?
- What `__init__` does?
- What an object is?
- The point of `self`?
- The two types of variables?

---

## Summary and Q&A

Class:

- A pre-defined structure that contains attributes and behaviors grouped together.
- The blueprint.
- Defined via a method call.
- Contains an `__init__` method that takes in parameters to be assigned to an object.
- E.g., the `Dog` class; the `List` class.

Object:

- An instance of a class structure.  
- The items built from the blueprint.
- E.g., the `gracie` object; the `my_list` object.

---

## Summary: Types of Variables in a Class

Instance variables:

- Contain data types declared in the class but defined in each object.
- Each `dog` has its own name and age.
- Each `my_list` has its own elements.

Class variables:

- Contain data and actions that span across all objects.
- How many `dog` objects are there in total?
- The `self` keyword lets us distinguish between variables that exist at the class level versus in each object.
