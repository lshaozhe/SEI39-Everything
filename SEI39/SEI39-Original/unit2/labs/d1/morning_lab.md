Try to recreate this wireframe with React. Be sure to create a few components (e.g. app, sidebar, reviews, average rating, sentiment analysis, website visitors).

## Get Started

### Set up

- You should use the starter-codes given this morning.

<!--
**index.html**

- add the following to index.html

```html
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react/16.3.2/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/react-dom/16.3.2/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/babel-standalone/6.26.0/babel.min.js"></script>
<script type="text/babel" src="app.js"></script>
```
 -->
 
**app.js**

- render and `h1` tag using react to test it:

```jsx
return(
  <h1>Commence Dashboard Creation!</h1>
);
```

#### Important Note

- To see updates you must refresh your browser, all three of the servers above do cache things, so you may have to do a hard refresh (hold shift key when doing a refresh) to see your changes. Remember `command shift r` as the hot keys

### Dark Theme!

Keep going! Add more details, add some css
