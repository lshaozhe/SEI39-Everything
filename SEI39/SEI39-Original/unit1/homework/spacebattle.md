# Space Battle Continued

All day you've been building Space Battle! Take the evening to finish it up


## Technical Requirements
Minimum Functionality Required for this homework to be considered complete:
1. A game that loads by opening an html file in the browser, the game works through the Chrome console, with alerts, console.log messages and prompts
    - Bonus: use DOM manipulation **instead** of alerts and prompts
1. A working game that loads without any syntax errors on start
1. You have a battleship that can attack an alien ship at least one time
    - Be sure to display this info somewhere - in the console or in an alert is fine
    - Remember, all ships should have: hitpoints(hull), damage points(firepower)
1. You have _at least_ one alien ship that has hitpoints and damage points that can attack your ship at least one time  
    - Again, be sure to display this info somewhere - in the console or in an alert is fine
1. The two ships battle until one is destroyed (i.e. has a hull <= 0) and a win/lose message is displayed
1. Refer to the original [markdown](../instructor_notes/space_battle.md) for more details
