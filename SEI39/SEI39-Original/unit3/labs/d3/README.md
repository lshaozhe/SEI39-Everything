# Biscoff Bakery

![](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/CIGk1sgCfSg/maxresdefault.jpg)

A new bakery specializing in Biscoff-inspired sweets is opening up soon and has asked you to help get their website started. They've given you some data to work with, but it's up to you to add some view layers to the app and add in some functionality that will allow the owners to add new baked goods when needed. Let's get started!

#### Learning Objectives

- Practice with setting up a basic express server with view layers

#### Prerequisites

- JavaScript
- Node
- Express 

---

## Getting Started

You can find the starter code for this morning's lab in `./biscoff-starter` -- work in that folder!

#### Provided in the starter code
1. `server.js` has a basic express server up and running, along with routes for *index* and *show*

1. `package.json` and `package-lock.json` have already been generated with express as a dependency
    - _Remember:_ what terminal command should you run to install dependencies from a package.json file?

1. `models/bakedgoods.js` holds your 'database' for this app, in this case a bunch of cookie butter based baked goods!

## Current Endpoints
The *index* and *show* routes sends JSON data to the browser

### Adding new routes (new and create)
1. Make a **post route** that handles the form submission and pushes the new baked good into the 'database'

### Hungry for More?

1. Practice some CSS/design and style the app! Want practice with using CSS frameworks? Consider using [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com/), [Materialize](http://materializecss.com/), [Bulma](https://bulma.io/), or find another of your choosing!
