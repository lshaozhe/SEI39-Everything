# Be careful with this command - cannot undo!

# Make sure you delete the right thing, or you could accidentally delete the contents of your computer (it has happened).

# This command will typically not ask you if you really want to delete. It will just delete so doublecheck you are deleting exactly what you mean to delete

# Remove `tie_fighters` 2 and 3.

# Touch a file in "**x_wing**" called "**the_force.txt**".

# Destroy the "**death_star**" and anyone inside of it.

# Return "**x_wing**" and the "**millenium_falcon**" to "**yavin_4**".

# Celebrate!
