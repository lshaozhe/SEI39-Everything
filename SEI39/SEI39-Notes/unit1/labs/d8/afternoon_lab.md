## The Task 

![](https://i.imgur.com/89MLBWz.png)

- Make a div with the text "Add random image". Add a class to make the div square (100 x 100). Give it some color.
- The div should have cursor: pointer in its CSS, so that when the user hovers the cursor over the div, the cursor turns into a pointer thing.
- Make an array of six image urls in your js file. (strings)
- Make it so that when you click the "Add random image" div, one random image from your array will appear on the page.
- Make it so that each image is re-sized to the same proportions as the square div (100 x 100). Or, you could use Google images -> Tools -> Size to source images at the size you want.
- Make it so an image is added rather than replaced.
- Make it so the images are added horizontally.

## Hungry for More? 

- Make it so that when you click on one of the added images, it will be removed from the page.
- Each added image can run the same function to achieve this goal.
