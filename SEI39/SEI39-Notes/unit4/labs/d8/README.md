# Routing Lab
-------

Using the opinionated framework in your new language create a new project and create and test the following routes. The end points are listed using express style route syntax.

| method | endpoint | return value |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| GET | /hello | {hello: "world"} |
| GET | /my/:id | {id: [id]} |
| POST| /getthebody | request body |
| GET | /getthequery | url query |
| GET | /:route/:param | {route: [route], param: [param]} |

## Hungry For More

- Google how to change the response headers 
- Look into CORS headers and what they mean
