## Overview
This lesson consists of a hands-on lab during which learners will independently create a working Python program. This lab builds on the previous lab, so starter code (which is the same solution code as the previous lab) is provided for them. You simply need to introduce the lab, make sure they have working starter code, make sure they can access the lab doc, and wait in case of questions; at the end, go over the solution (in the solution-code folder).


## Learning Objectives
In this lesson, students will:
- Apply what they've learned to create a working Python program.

## You Do: Unit 2 Lab - Control Flow

Do you remember the first unit lab? You have a print statement to show the user a movie title and rating.

In today's lab, you will use functions, `if` statements, and loops. By the end, your movie app will print a movie title, a movie rating, or both, depending on a string value.

**The lab has its instructions included. Open the stater codes and follow the instructions there.**


Try your best! Raise your hand if you really need help.

1 HOUR 18 MINUTES


**Talking Points**:

- Remember, throughout the course, there is a lab at the end of each unit. Each lab builds upon the last.

- Does anyone need help with the starter code?

- Right now, let's set up the functions and control flow to print out the values of our variables.

## Debrief: Unit 2 Lab - Control Flow

How did it go?

Let's go over it.

Make sure your code works - the Unit 3 lab builds off this one!

<aside class="notes">

**Talking Points**:

- Bring up the solution (in the `solution-code` directory) and walk them through it. Be sure everyone understands - and be sure everyone's code is accurate, because the next lab will build off this one!

## Unit 2 Wrap Up

What'd we cover?

- Conditionals and Boolean Values
- Lists - `append`, `len`, `pop`, and `insert`.
- Loops - `for` loops, `while` loops, and `range`.
- Functions - including parameters and return statements.
- Function arguments - `*args`, kwargs, and `**kwargs`

Questions?

5 MINUTES

**Talking Points**:
- Wow, we've covered a lot, and we're just getting started! Let's take a minute to review what we've learned so far.
- I'm going to read through the topics for Unit 2. As I do so, I want you to tell me how confident you feel that you've mastered each one, on a scale of 0 to 5.
-- Hold up your fist to indicate 0 - you don't feel confident at all that you mastered this objective.
-- Hold up all five fingers to indicate 5 - you feel super confident. You're an expert!
