# General Guidelines for the Team:

The src folder structure is as follows:

- assets
  - images, logos etc from UX team
- common
  - reusable components across pages should be saved here
- components
  - code concerning logic for pages (how things work)
- data
  - dummy data for front-end to use while back-end is created can be saved here
- hooks
  - custom hooks will be saved here
- pages
  - for presentation only for pages (mainly for HTML rendering)
- App.js
  - routes & context will be saved here

Ground rules:

- Make names as descriptive as possible
- Divide your code into sections by commenting out headers e.g.
  /_ ===============================================
  // HEADER
  =============================================== _/
- Comment every piece of code you write (except those very basic ones that everyone can understand at a glance). To standardise, write your comment ABOVE the code
- For small components that will appear in more than one section, please save in the common folder.
- Double check that a common component has not already been written before you write your own.

# Frameworks Used
