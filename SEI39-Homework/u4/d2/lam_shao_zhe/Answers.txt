What is a nested loop?
nested loop is one where there is one or more loops within a main loop

Which kind of loop is based on a conditional statement: while loops or for loops?
both while loop and for loop run would only run when the conditional statement is ran

When you want to iterate a specific number of times, would you typically use a while loop or a for loop?
for loop, as you can control the start and end, while while loop only specifies the end condition (so for loop cannot control number of times ran)

Is it possible to loop through a string one letter at a time? What is the example given in the article?
yes, the string can be treated as a list as follows:

sammy = 'Sammy'

for letter in sammy:
   print(letter)

Extrapolate from what you learned in the articles: Do you think a for loop can be nested inside a while loop? Why or why not?
yes, an example would be instead of nesting for loops for multi dimensional datasets, one can switch the outer for loop into a while loop
