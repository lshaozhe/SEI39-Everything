1. Use an array of objects

1. Combine objects, arrays, and functions

## Use an array inside an object

Let's model an adventurer who has belongings (a list)

```javascript
const adventurer = {
 name: "Timothy",
 hitpoints: 10,
 belongings: ["sword", "potion", "Tums"]
}
```

Access all values in the player.belongings array:

```javascript
console.log(adventurer.belongings);
```

Access a specific item in the belongings array:

```javascript
console.log(adventurer.belongings[0]);
```

## Iterate over an array that is within an object

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < adventurer.belongings.length; i++) {
 console.log(adventurer.belongings[i]);
}
```

## Use an object within an object

Our adventurer now has a companion! Our companion, a **bat**, is an object with its own properties.

Add the `companion` object to the `adventurer` object:

```javascript
const adventurer = {
 name: "Timothy",
 hitpoints: 10,
 belongings: ["sword", "potion", "Tums"],
 companion: {
  name: "Velma",
  type: "Bat"
 }
}
```

Access the companion object:

```javascript
console.log(adventurer.companion);
```

> => { name: "Velma", type: "Bat" }

Access the companion's name:

```javascript
console.log(adventurer.companion.name);
```

> => "Velma"

Access the companion's type:

```javascript
console.log(adventurer.companion.type);
```

> => "Bat"

## Use an object within an object within an object

Velma the bat also has a companion, a magical **parasite** called Tim.

Let's add **Tim** to our data:

```javascript
const adventurer = {
 name: Timothy,
 hitpoints: 10,
 belongings: ["sword", "potion", "Tums"],
 companion: {
  name: "Velma",
  type: "Bat"
  companion: {
   name: "Tim",
   type: "Parasite"
  }  
 }
}
```

**What would you write to:**

* `console.log` Tim's **type**

## Use an array within an object within an object within an object

Tim has a **bag of holding** and can carry an infinite number of belongings.

Let's add an array of belongings to Tim:

```javascript
const adventurer = {
 name: 'Timothy',
 hitpoints: 10,
 belongings: ["sword", "potion", "Tums"],
 companion: {
  name: "Velma",
  type: "Bat",
  companion: {
   name: "Tim",
   type: "Parasite",
   belongings: ["SCUBA tank", "Rogan josh", "health insurance"]
  }  
 }
}
```

**What would your write to:**

* `console.log` "health insurance"

## Use an array of objects

A common pattern you will start to see everywhere (especially in Unit 2 and onwards) is an **array of objects**.

An array of objects can look like this:

```javascript
const movies = [
  { title: "Tokyo Story" },
  { title: "Paul Blart: Mall Cop" },
  { title: "L'Avventura" },
];
```

These objects have no names, they are just anonymous objects packed into an array.

You could reference them with indexes as usual:

```javascript
console.log(movies[0]);
```

You could reference the properties by first asking for the index, then the property:

```javascript
console.log(movies[0].title);
```

You could loop over the array and just print all of the titles:

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i < movies.length; i++) {
 console.log(movies[i].title);
}
```

## Use variables to store a key

```javascript
const monster =  {
 name: 'Slimer',
 age: 6
}

const someVar = 'name';

console.log(monster[someVar]);  // same as monster['name'];
```

> => 'Slimer'

## Loop over an object

There are two way to loop over objects. You can use either way. Both ways involve looping over the object's **keys**.

Let's say we have a movie object:

```javascript
const movie = {
  title: "L'Avventura",
  director: "Michelangelo Antonioni",
  year: 1960,
};
```

### `for ... in` loop

Print each key:

```javascript
for (const key in movie) {
 console.log(key);
}
```

> =>
>
>title
>
>director
>
>year

Print each value:

To do this, use the key as a **variable** within the square brackets.

```javascript
for (const key in movie) {
 console.log(movie[key]);
}
```

> =>
>
>L'Avventura
>
>Michelangelo Antonioni
>
>1960

### `Object.keys()`

Object.keys() will return an **array of keys**

```javascript
console.log(Object.keys(movie));
```

> => [ 'title', 'director', 'year' ]

To print the values, use the key as a **variable** within square brackets.

```javascript
const keys = Object.keys(movie);

for (let i = 0; i < keys.length; i++) {
 console.log(movie[keys[i]]);
}
```

## Combine objects, arrays, and functions

You can create a property for an object that is an array

```javascript
const foo = {
    someArray:[1,2,3]
};
foo.someArray[0]; //1
```

You can create a property for an object that is an object

```javascript
const foo = {
    someObject: {
        someProperty: 'oh hai!'
    }
};
foo.someObject.someProperty; //oh hai!
```

You can create a property for an object that is a function (method)

```javascript
const foo = {
  someMethod: () => {
    console.log("oh hai");
  },
};

foo.someMethod(); //logs 'oh hai!'
```

You can store an object in an array

```javascript
const foo = [{ someProperty: "weee" }, 2, 3];

console.log(foo[0].someProperty);
```

You can store an array in an array

```javascript
const foo = [
  ["0,0", "0,1", "0,2"],
  ["1,0", "1,1", "1,2"],
  ["2,0", "2,1", "2,2"],
];

foo[1][2]; //1,2
```

You can store a function in an array

```javascript
const foo = [
  1,
  "hi",
  () => {
    console.log("fun");
  },
];

foo[2]();
```
